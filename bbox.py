class BoundingBox(tuple):
    """
    Define geographic bounding box. Use official order for parameters, as
    south, west, north, east
    >>> b = BoundingBox(48.5766,7.5929,48.6057,7.6645)
    >>> b
    (48.5766, 7.5929, 48.6057, 7.6645)

    or string
    >>> b = BoundingBox("48.5766,7.5929,48.6057,7.6645")
    >>> b
    (48.5766, 7.5929, 48.6057, 7.6645)

    or string with parenthesis
    >>> b = BoundingBox("(48.5766, 7.5929, 48.6057, 7.6645)")
    >>> b
    (48.5766, 7.5929, 48.6057, 7.6645)

    You can use it as tuple
    >>> s, w, n, e = b
    >>> s, w, n, e
    (48.5766, 7.5929, 48.6057, 7.6645)

    And you can iter on it:
    >>> vs =[c for c in b]
    >>> vs
    [48.5766, 7.5929, 48.6057, 7.6645]

    You can pass args as tuple like this
    >>> b = BoundingBox((48.5766,7.5929,48.6057,7.6645))
    >>> b
    (48.5766, 7.5929, 48.6057, 7.6645)

    or with 2 points:
    >>> b = BoundingBox((48.5766,7.5929),(48.6057,7.6645))
    >>> b
    (48.5766, 7.5929, 48.6057, 7.6645)

    BoundingBox reorder values if necessary:
    >>> b = BoundingBox((48.6057,7.6645), (48.5766,7.5929))
    >>> b
    (48.5766, 7.5929, 48.6057, 7.6645)
    
    Properties and aliases are also defined for comprehensive access:
    >>> (b.west,b.east) == (b.xmin,b.xmax)
    True
